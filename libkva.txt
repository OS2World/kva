                          Support SNAP/WarpOverlay!/VMAN/DIVE

v1.2.4 :
    * Introduced KVA_AUTOMODE to override kva mode if auto mode
        - SNAP, WO, VMAN and DIVE are available
        - For example, in order to use DIVE mode as a default mode, do
            set KVA_AUTOMODE=DIVE

    * Fixed DIVE is always used if HW is not availble
        - VMAN is checked, too

v1.2.3 :
    * Fixed the crash on AUTO mode or SNAP mode if SDDGRADD.DLL(
    SET C1=SDDGRADD in config.sys ) was not loaded, but SDDHELP.SYS was loaded.
    * Distribute a DLL, kva0.dll.

v1.2.2 :
    * Added rclDstRect to KVASETUP to support to display an image into a
    destination rectangle.

    scaling is required.

v1.2.0 :
    * Added BGR4 supports for DIVE and VMAN
    * Added VMAN-backend supports. This can give Panorama users some helps.

v1.1.3 :
    * Fixed the problem that a program exits abnormally due to
    "Unable to open SDDHELP$ helper device driver!" if auto mode was selected
    when using Panorama driver.

v1.1.2 :
    * Added the following fields to struct tagKVACAPS
        ULONG   ulRMask;
        ULONG   ulGMask;
        ULONG   ulBMask;

    * Fixed the problem that the movie disappears after minimizing and
    restoring a window, especially, of Qt4 on SNAP/WO mode.
    *Added supports of partial blitting of source image, aka crop.
    * Removed the overhead to allocate/free an image buffer on DIVE mode.
